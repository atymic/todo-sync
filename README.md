# TodoSync

TodoSync is a tool that sync google reminders directly to todoist.  
You can check out the free hosted version using at [todo-sync.atymic.dev](https://todo-sync.atymic.dev/) or self host
on your own server.

## Bug Reports

Feel free to post bug reports as issues and i'll look into them :)

## Self Hosting

At some point i'll write some documentation on how to get up and running on your own server :) For the moment, have a go
and create an issue if you get stuck.
