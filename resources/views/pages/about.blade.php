                    I built this tool after getting annoyed constantly at the horrible user experience of google reminders.
                    For something that exists across so many google products, it's inconsistent and hard to use.

                    Todoist, on the other hand, is an awesome service. One of the things that I've missed was being able
                    to yell tasks at my google home/phone/whatever, so I built this to sync them across automatically ðŸŽ‰
